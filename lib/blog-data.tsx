# Building Design Systems That Scale

Design systems are more than just a collection of componentsâ€”they're the foundation of consistent, scalable product development. After building and maintaining design systems across multiple products and teams, I've learned some valuable lessons about what makes them successful.

## The Foundation: Principles Over Pixels

The most successful design systems start with **clear principles**, not components. Before diving into button variants and color palettes, establish:

- **Design principles** that guide decision-making
- *Brand values* that inform aesthetic choices  
- ***User experience goals*** that drive functionality

> "A design system is a living, breathing thing that evolves with your product and team." - Brad Frost

## Component Architecture

When building components, think in systems:

\`\`\`tsx
// Good: Flexible, composable
<Button variant="primary" size="large" icon={<Icon />}>
  Submit Form
</Button>

// Better: Semantic, purposeful
<SubmitButton loading={isSubmitting}>
  Create Account
</SubmitButton>
\`\`\`
`
  }
  // Add the rest of the blog posts here
];

// Function to get blog posts for static site generation
export function getBlogPosts(): BlogPost[] {
  return blogPostsData;
}

// Export for backward compatibility
export const blogPosts = blogPostsData;
