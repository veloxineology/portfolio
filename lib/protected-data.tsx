You want to listen to music? You listen to my playlists. You want to go to school? Everyone is convinced we're married or smth atp. I'm not saying I'll be completely fine if something ever goes wrong, but maybe it's because I'm one bitch, but though I'll take your opinion or Keerthana's opinion or my parents opinion, I'll end up doing whatever I like only*",
