# Customization

## Theming
- Edit `tailwind.config.js` and `app/globals.css` for color and style changes.
- Use the built-in theme switcher for light/dark mode.

## Layout Tweaks
- Adjust padding, spacing, and breakpoints in `app/globals.css`.
- Modify the floating navbar in `components/floating-navbar.tsx`.

## Adding New Sections
- Add new cards or sections by creating components in `components/` and including them in the relevant page (e.g., `home-page.tsx`).
